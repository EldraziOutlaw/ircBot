ekimekim : I use # on each line for internal comments, docstrings for public interface
EldraziOutlaw : test
EldraziOutlaw : :O
EldraziOutlaw : I now have logging that logs a persons name and message instead of just everything
EldraziOutlaw : ACTION tests actions
EldraziOutlaw : ACTION is kinda happy with how this is going :)
EldraziOutlaw : ekimekim: thank you for the help yesterday btw
Tyranic-Moron : IRC bots are a nice project to get instant results from (once the initial connection stuff is written)
EldraziOutlaw : so good for learning then :P
Tyranic-Moron : yep yep
EldraziOutlaw : ugh
Didero : "kind of happy" followed by "ugh" does summarize programming pretty well, yeah
EldraziOutlaw : Didero: that was actually at github, needing my to use 2fa when my phone is dead >.>
EldraziOutlaw : Tyranic-Moron: with github, when it says your name... does that my my real name, or my user name on github?
Didero : You have to use 2fa now?
ekimekim : EldraziOutlaw: it can be what you like
Starnerf : they actually ask for your birth certificate for verification
Starnerf : especially if you're from a country where they don't give out birth certificates
Tyranic-Moron : lol
Tyranic-Moron : yeah, any name

Didero : Imgur is ruining my brain
Tyranic-Moron : I used my real name because I used it as a portfolio for jerbs and Tyranic-Moron didn't seem like the best choice there :P
EldraziOutlaw : haha
EldraziOutlaw : ACTION thinks they did the ssh key thing correctly
EldraziOutlaw : man githubs guides are kinda awkward
EldraziOutlaw : Tyranic-Moron: ok so I have git installed... now wut
Tyranic-Moron : did you make a repo on github yet?

Tyranic-Moron : https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/
PyMoronBot : Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line - User Documentation (at help.github.com)
EldraziOutlaw : that...
lunik1 : make sure to use the url for ssh!
EldraziOutlaw : ok am I missing something, because that page is literally just a warning with no info on it
lunik1 : yes
Tyranic-Moron : there's a 9-step thing underneath that
lunik1 : you are missing something
EldraziOutlaw : It has "Putting your existing work on GitHub can let you share and collaborate in lots of great ways." then a warning about not sharing passwords, and then further reading
EldraziOutlaw : I am not seeing any steps
EldraziOutlaw : lunik1: probably not because apparently github is not showing me any fucking steps to do shit
Tyranic-Moron : steps disappear if I disable javascript
Tyranic-Moron : so check that?
EldraziOutlaw : oh apparently they don't show up unless you click the very very tiny linux word
lunik1 : that's odd
